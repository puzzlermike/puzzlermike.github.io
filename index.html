                Hi!<br /><br />
                
                My name is Michael and I enjoy designing and writing software.<br />
                I love building meaningful products with a group of motivated engineers.<br />
                I feel comfortable being an IC, lead developer or even an architect.<br /><br />

                Currently, I work as a technical lead for an international company where our team is responsible for the Authentication, Authorization and Auditing platform.<br />
                In the recent past I worked heavily with Java frameworks like Jakarta EE and Spring but also used Golang and its ecosystem for system development and various scripting languages for automation.<br />
                Beside that I gathered a lot of experience in the DevOps realm by working with a couple of technologies listed on the <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/" target="_blank">CNCF landscape</a>.<br /><br />

                Right now I am specializing in Authn/Authz topics, the Google Cloud Platform and DevOps topics in general.
