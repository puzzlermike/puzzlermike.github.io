Hi!

My name is Michael and I enjoy designing and writing software.
I love building meaningful products with a group of motivated engineers.
I feel comfortable being an IC, lead developer or even an architect.

Currently, I work as a technical lead for an international company where our team is responsible for the Authentication, Authorization and Auditing platform.
In the recent past I worked heavily with Java frameworks like Jakarta EE and Spring but also used Golang and its ecosystem for system development and various scripting languages for automation.
Beside that I gathered a lot of experience in the DevOps realm by working with a couple of technologies listed on the <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/" target="_blank">CNCF landscape</a>.

Right now I am specializing in Authn/Authz topics, the Google Cloud Platform and DevOps topics in general.
